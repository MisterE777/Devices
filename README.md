# Devices
This is the code for the Candle smart home devices.


### 433 Hub

This is a device that can learn to recognise and also replay almost any signal from 433Mhz devices.

It is highly recommended to attach an Open Smart touch screen. This allows you to replay signals by pressing buttons on the screen. It also guides you through the proces of copying the signals, such as when to press the buttons on a remote control that you are copying.
- Signals are stored in the Arduino memory, and it can hold between 10 and 20 signals.


### Temperature and more sensor

This sensor measures temperature (in Celcius or Fahrenheit), air humidity and air pressure. 

It has an optional TFT screen on which it displays:
- Temperature, also as a simple graph
- humidity, also as a simple graph
- Air pressure
- Weather predition icon
